# Corporate-Stability-Predictor

Project Overview
This project focuses on assessing the investment viability of companies through predictive modeling based on financial metrics. Key tasks include web scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training machine learning models.

Key Features
Web Scraping: Extracted financial data from an online vendor.
Metric Calculation: Computed key financial ratios such as:
Current Ratio
LTD-to-Earnings
Return on Equity (ROE)
Debt-to-EBIT
Interest Coverage Ratio
Data Preprocessing:
Handled imbalanced datasets using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
Cleaned and standardized financial data for analysis.
Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated models like AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Neighbors Classifier.
Achieved a high prediction accuracy of 97.43% for investment viability.
Libraries and Tools Used
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model development and evaluation.
Results
This project successfully identified investment-viable companies using advanced machine learning techniques and financial metrics, achieving robust prediction performance.
